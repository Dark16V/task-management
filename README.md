# Task management
## The project is still under development and has many nuances.

To use it, follow these steps

1. First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dark16V/task-management.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd ./task-management
```
3. Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then install the dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Finally, start the local server using Uvicorn and open your browser at `127.0.0.1:8000`.
```bash

```
